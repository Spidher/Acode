# Twitter API Interaction Script "xrequest.py"

This Python script interacts with the Twitter API for various operations, including user lookups, posting tweets, and deleting tweets. It utilizes the Twitter API v2 endpoints to perform these tasks.

## Features

- **User Lookup:** Retrieve user information by username.
- **Post Tweet:** Post a new tweet.
- **Delete Tweet:** Delete a tweet by its ID.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library
- `requests_oauthlib` library

Setup

1. Install Dependencies:

   Ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install requests requests_oauthlib
   ```

2. Create `keys.csv`:

   Create a `keys.csv` file in the same directory as the script. This file should contain your Twitter API keys and tokens. The format should be:
   ```
   name,token
   Api_key,<your_api_key>
   Api_secret_key,<your_api_secret_key>
   Access_token,<your_access_token>
   Access_token_secret,<your_access_token_secret>
   bearer_token,<your_bearer_token>
   ```

 Usage

Run the script with the desired action and parameters. The script supports the following actions:

- **User Lookup (`ul`):** Retrieve user information by username.
  ```bash
  python xrequests.py ul <username>
  ```

- **Post Tweet (`p`):** Post a new tweet with the specified text.
  ```bash
  python xrequests.py p "<tweet_text>"
  ```

- **Delete Tweet (`d`):** Delete a tweet by its ID.
  ```bash
  python xrequests.py d <tweet_id>
  ```

### Example

- To look up a user with username `jack`:
  ```bash
  python xrequests.py ul jack
  ```

- To post a tweet with text "Hello Twitter!":
  ```bash
  python xrequests.py p "Hello Twitter!"
  ```

- To delete a tweet with ID `1234567890`:
  ```bash
  python xrequests.py d 1234567890
  ```

 Files Created

- **`ul_response.csv`**: Contains the response from the user lookup operation.
- **`post_response.csv`**: Contains the response from the post tweet operation.

Notes

- Ensure that your API keys and tokens are kept secure and not shared publicly.
- The script assumes that the `keys.csv` file is correctly formatted and located in the same directory.
